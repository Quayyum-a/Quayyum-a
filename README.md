## 🚀 About Me  

I'm a solutions-driven software engineer with a passion for building scalable, privacy-first applications and leading high-performing teams. My expertise spans full-stack development, system architecture, and AI integration, with a knack for turning complex problems into elegant solutions.  

When I'm not coding, I'm mentoring the next generation of developers or exploring future-focused engineering trends at the intersection of AI, logistics, and healthcare tech.
